I had issues with connecting to the database. At first I had a "error: password authentication failed for user 'postgres'", fixed that temporarily
by uninstalling postgresql but the error comes back.

This repository is the client (front-end) starter code for Final Project (CRUD Application).

### Use the following steps to set up and run the client (front-end) application on your local machine
1.	Download the GitHub repository ZIP file to your local machine and unzip it.
2. Start a terminal (e.g., Git Bash) on your local machine.
3.	Go into the "client-starter-code" folder, enter the command to install dependencies: `npm install` 
4.	Start the client application by entering the command: `npm start` 
5.	After the client application is successfully started, a web browser is automatically opened at the address: `http://localhost:3000`
